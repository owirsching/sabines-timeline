                            In The Republic, Cicero examines the ideal state of government and political theory throughout the history of Rome. Cicero recounts the myth of the Rape of the Sabine Women to emphasis how Rome’s founding depended on compromise and resolution on behalf of its leaders. Through analysis of Romulus’s leadership, Cicero details the steps Romulus took to establish and strengthen Rome, “he adopted a strange and somewhat clownish plan, but worthy of a great man, whose providence extended far into futurity.” The plan Cicero refers to is the Rape of the Sabine Women where “[Romulus] ordered [the Sabine women] to be seized during the sports, and gave them in marriage to the most honourable families.” Cicero’s narrative of the myth describes the event as a necessary development for the growth of Rome. Rather than exploiting the Sabine women, Cicero comments that they were respected through honorable marriage. The individuality of the Sabine women is stripped as they are viewed as pawns in Romulus’s political schemes. In response to the outrage of the Sabines, Romulus invited their king Tatius into the Roman government. Romulus compromised his power in Rome to develop an alliance with Tatius. Cicero states Romulus achieved his goal to further strengthen Rome, “his government became much better established, aided by the authority and counsel of the fathers.” The exploitation of the Sabine women was reconciled through compromise with their fathers, and as Cicero argued, the greatest benefit to Rome was the contributions of their fathers to the establishment of the Roman government.

                            Ovid’s two works the Ars Amatoria and Fasti mention the rape of the Sabines. The Ars Amatoria, translated as the “Art of Love,” is a three-part instructional work on the art of seduction and romantic pursuits. Likely because of its genre, Ovid’s description of the rape of the Sabines in Ars Amatoria is set in a theatre for dramatic effect. This contradicts what was popular consensus during Ovid’s time, that the rape of the Sabines occurred while Romulus was holding a horse race in the circus. Other classic versions of the rape of the Sabines either explicitly name this horse race setting or mention the agricultural god Consus in their accounts. Consus is associated with horses and horse races, and makes those accounts compatible with a circus setting. Indeed, in Ovid’s Fasti, a poetic interpretation of the traditions and myths associated with each month of the Roman Calendar, Ovid mentions Consus in reference to the Sabine women, in Book III in his section on the Kalends of March. On this day, the Sabine women helped resolve the conflict between the Roman settlers, their husbands and abducters, and the Sabine people, their fathers and brothers. They are referred to as the “ravished women … now almost mothers,” which acknowledges their previous abduction and rape. The Sabine women walk into the battlefield between their husbands and fathers, holding their children to their chests, “They knelt on the ground, their grandchildren, as if they understood, / With sweet cries, stretching out their little arms to their grandfathers: / Those who could, called to their grandfather, seen for the first time” (Book III, March 1: Kalends). Both ranks of fathers and husbands are moved to stop the conflict, “The arms and passions of the warriors fall: dropping their swords / Fathers and sons-in-law grasp each other’s hands, / They embrace the women, praising them, and the grandfather / Bears his grandchild on his shield: a sweeter use for it” (Book III, March 1: Kalends). This dramatic scene is integral to the image of the Sabine women in Roman myth, and will be recreated in renaissance art such as The Intervention of the Sabine Women (1799) by Jacques-Louis David.

                            Although Ovid’s Fasti only casually mentions that the Sabine women were “ravished” and focuses on an episode after the rape, his poetry in Ars Amatoria includes an explicit depiction of the rape of the Sabines, and sets the rape in a Roman theatre. The humorous tone throughout Ars Amatoria is maintained in this poem on the rape of the Sabines. The lightheartedness of Ovid’s narratorial voice over the graphic and traumatic scene being described lends criticism towards this myth being so honored in Roman culture and in the founding myth. The line “Ah, Romulus, you knew how to give a soldier a bonus; with that kind of perk, even I would enlist” evokes this method of irony through lightheartedness (Ars Amatoria, Book I, Abduction of the Sabines).
