                            In The Republic, Cicero examines the ideal state of government and political theory throughout the history of Rome. Cicero recounts the myth of the Rape of the Sabine Women to emphasis how Rome’s founding depended on compromise and resolution on behalf of its leaders. Through analysis of Romulus’s leadership, Cicero details the steps Romulus took to establish and strengthen Rome, “he adopted a strange and somewhat clownish plan, but worthy of a great man, whose providence extended far into futurity.” The plan Cicero refers to is the Rape of the Sabine Women where “[Romulus] ordered [the Sabine women] to be seized during the sports, and gave them in marriage to the most honourable families.” Cicero’s narrative of the myth describes the event as a necessary development for the growth of Rome. Rather than exploiting the Sabine women, Cicero comments that they were respected through honorable marriage. The individuality of the Sabine women is stripped as they are viewed as pawns in Romulus’s political schemes. In response to the outrage of the Sabines, Romulus invited their king Tatius into the Roman government. Romulus compromised his power in Rome to develop an alliance with Tatius. Cicero states Romulus achieved his goal to further strengthen Rome, “his government became much better established, aided by the authority and counsel of the fathers.” The exploitation of the Sabine women was reconciled through compromise with their fathers, and as Cicero argued, the greatest benefit to Rome was the contributions of their fathers to the establishment of the Roman government.

                        <div class="description">Famous Roman historian Livy includes a chapter titled “The Rape of the Sabines” (Ch 9) in Book I of The History of Rome. Livy poses the rape of the Sabine women as necessary to the creation of Rome, producing offspring for the all-male and otherwise unreproductive population of Romulus’ early followers. He begins his account of the rape, “The Roman State had now become so strong that it was a match for any of its neighbors in war, but its greatness threatened to last for only one generation, since through the absence of women there was no hope of offspring, and there was no right of intermarriage with their neighbors” (The History of Rome, Book I, Ch. 9). Romulus and the other Romans asked their neighboring populations for the right to intermarriage, but to no avail. Livy writes, “usually they were dismissed with the question, ‘whether they had opened an asylum for women, for nothing short of that would secure for them inter-marriage on equal terms.’ The Roman youth could ill brook such insults, and matters began to look like an appeal to force” (The History of Rome, Book I, Ch. 9).</div>

                        The Sabine women come to the early Roman settlement for the Consualia, a festival for Neptune, disguising the venue in which the Sabines will be abducted. The abduction is described, “When the hour for the games had come, and their eyes and minds were alike riveted on the spectacle before them, the preconcerted signal was given and the Roman youth dashed in all directions to carry off the maidens who were present. The larger part were carried off indiscriminately, but some particularly beautiful girls who had been marked out for the leading patricians were carried to their houses by plebeians told off for the task” (The History of Rome, Book I, Ch. 9). Livy does not write that Romulus specifically gave the signal for his army of men to abduct the Sabines, but this detail is popular among other versions of the myth.

                        Particularly unfair blame is placed on the Sabine women as the culprits of their own rape. Romulus blames the Sabine people’s pride, or superbia, for causing the rape, “Romulus, however, went round in person, and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbors” (The History of Rome, Book I, Ch. 9). In the next chapter, he writes that the women are no longer affected by their condition of being abducted and married by force, “The feelings of the abducted maidens were now pretty completely appeased” (The History of Rome, Book I, Ch. 10).
                    </div>
                    <div class="description">In a future episode of the founding myth, the Sabine women intervene in the conflict between the Roman settlers and Sabine people, and this episode is relayed in Chapter 13, in the section “Peace and Union with the Sabines.” As Livy blamed the Sabine women for their own abduction, he also blames them for causing the war between the Sabines and Romans. Through dialogue, Livy even has the Sabine women recite this blame themselves, “‘If,’ they cried, ‘you are weary of these ties of kindred, these marriage-bonds, then turn your anger upon us; it is we who are the cause of the war, it is we who have wounded and slain our husbands and fathers. Better for us to perish rather than live without one or the other of you, as widows or as orphans’” (The History of Rome, Book I, Ch. 13).                    </div>

                            In Florus’ Epitome, concise and condensed history of Rome, covering major events from the foundation of the city to the era of the Roman Empire, ending with the closing of the Gates of Janus by Augustus in 25 B.C. It is a panegyric on the greatness of Rome and divides the life of the empire into three periods, Rome’s infancy, youth and manhood. In Book I, “The Period of the Seven Kings, beginning with Romulus,” Florus includes the rape of the Sabines in his account of the empire’s early foundations. From Florus’ account, Romulus enters the country under Aeneas, “gathered together a single body consisting of various ingredients and, as king, himself created the Roman people” (Epitome, Book I). He continues,  “But a population consisting solely of men could only last for a single lifetime; wives were, therefore, demanded from the neighbouring peoples and, when they were refused, were seized by force. For, a pretence being made of holding horse-races, the maidens who had come to look on were carried off. This immediately gave rise to wars.” Florus’ account of the Rape of the Sabines is not an entirely creative or critical one, but a traditional interpretation of the rape as it pertains to the foundational myth of Rome. The rape is seen as perhaps unfortunate, but natural and necessary step in creating a Roman people.

                            Virgil’s epic Aeneid glorifies the beginnings of Rome. In Book VIII, Virgil writes about a shield forged by Venus to protect her son Aeneas in war against the native inhabitants of Italy. Prophecy decreed that the shield will help guide Rome to great triumph for centuries to come. Virgil argued that Aeneas’s virtues of loyalty to the state and devotion to family are Roman ideals that connect to the prophecy and will help Rome prosper. The Rape of the Sabine Women is an pivotal foundational myth that the shield foreshadows where Aeneas’s virtues prevail to help Rome. In the myth, the kidnapped Sabine women are driven by love for their new Roman husbands and their Sabine brothers and fathers to beg for peace between Romans and Sabines. The women want to remain in Rome because Roman virtues of loyalty to the state and devotion to the family are powerful enough to unify two warring cities.

                            Dionysius of Halicarnassus produced Roman Antiquities to educate the Greek people on Roman history. In his work, he incorporates the myth of the Rape of the Sabine Women into the history of Rome’s founding. In Book II of Roman Antiquities, Dionysius speculates the reason for the seizing of the virgins can be attributed to “the design of contracting an alliance with the neighboring cities, founded on affinity.” Dionysius argues that Romulus orchestrated the Rape of the Sabine Women to unite the Sabines and the Romans. Appealing to Greek mythology, Dionysius alludes to an oracle who urged Romulus to seize the Sabine women “indicating as they did that the difficulties and dangers would be great but that their outcome would be prosperous.” In response to the Rape of the Sabine Women, Rome went to war with the Sabines. However, Romulus did not want to return the women because they did not want to leave their Roman husbands, “they themselves were not unwilling to live with their husbands, should be permitted to remain with them.” Dionysius describes the complexity of the desires of the Sabine women because they both miss their Sabine families and want to stay with their new husbands, and he emphasizes the bravery and noble values of the women in their intervention when the women “delivered a long and pathetic plea, begging them [the Sabine men] to grant peace to those who were interceding for their husbands and on whose account… the war had been undertaken.” The Sabine women are illustrated as harnessing their emotions to prevent further bloodshed and beg for a union between the Sabines and Romans. Dionysius’s incorporation of the Rape of the Sabine Women presents women during Ancient Rome as emotional vessels that helped Rome grow to achieve its greatness.

                            Ovid’s two works the Ars Amatoria and Fasti mention the rape of the Sabines. The Ars Amatoria, translated as the “Art of Love,” is a three-part instructional work on the art of seduction and romantic pursuits. Likely because of its genre, Ovid’s description of the rape of the Sabines in Ars Amatoria is set in a theatre for dramatic effect (1). This contradicts what was popular consensus during Ovid’s time, that the rape of the Sabines occurred while Romulus was holding a horse race in the circus. Other classic versions of the rape of the Sabines either explicitly name this horse race setting or mention the agricultural god Consus in their accounts (2). Consus is associated with horses and horse races, and makes those accounts compatible with a circus setting. Indeed, in Ovid’s Fasti, a poetic interpretation of the traditions and myths associated with each month of the Roman Calendar, Ovid mentions Consus in reference to the Sabine women, in Book III in his section on the Kalends of March. On this day, the Sabine women helped resolve the conflict between the Roman settlers, their husbands and abducters, and the Sabine people, their fathers and brothers. They are referred to as the “ravished women … now almost mothers,” which acknowledges their previous abduction and rape. The Sabine women walk into the battlefield between their husbands and fathers, holding their children to their chests, “They knelt on the ground, their grandchildren, as if they understood, / With sweet cries, stretching out their little arms to their grandfathers: / Those who could, called to their grandfather, seen for the first time” (Book III, March 1: Kalends). Both ranks of fathers and husbands are moved to stop the conflict, “The arms and passions of the warriors fall: dropping their swords / Fathers and sons-in-law grasp each other’s hands, / They embrace the women, praising them, and the grandfather / Bears his grandchild on his shield: a sweeter use for it” (Book III, March 1: Kalends). This dramatic scene is integral to the image of the Sabine women in Roman myth, and will be recreated in renaissance art such as The Intervention of the Sabine Women (1799) by Jacques-Louis David.

                            Although Ovid’s Fasti only casually mentions that the Sabine women were “ravished” and focuses on an episode after the rape, his poetry in Ars Amatoria includes an explicit depiction of the rape of the Sabines, and sets the rape in a Roman theatre. The humorous tone throughout Ars Amatoria is maintained in this poem on the rape of the Sabines. The lightheartedness of Ovid’s narratorial voice over the graphic and traumatic scene being described lends criticism towards this myth being so honored in Roman culture and in the founding myth. The line “Ah, Romulus, you knew how to give a soldier a bonus; with that kind of perk, even I would enlist” evokes this method of irony through lightheartedness (Ars Amatoria, Book I, Abduction of the Sabines).

                            In The Parallel Lives, Plutarch writes a unique work of Greek literature that pairs Greek and Roman characters together to tell history through the lens of their personal virtues and vices. While writing of the life of Romulus, Plutarch includes the Rape of the Sabine Women to elaborate on the obstacles Romulus faced to ensure the future success of Rome. Plutarch provides a vivid description of the kidnapping including Romulus’s planning and the chaotic aftermath. In his description of the aftermath, he uses dialogue to emphasize the complex narrative of the Sabine women, “If, however, the war is on our behalf, carry us away with your sons-in‑law and their children, and so restore us to our fathers and kindred, but do not rob us of our children and husbands. Let us not, we beseech you, become prisoners of war again.” The Sabine women transition from victims of Rome to brave advocates of peace between two cities. The transition of the Sabine women is a vital component of Romulus’s story because the Roman men were able to win over women who resented them through their honor and goodwill as husbands. It is reflective of the virtues upon which Romulus wanted to build Rome. Plutarch notes a bridal tradition that has persisted to modern day, “And it continues to be a custom down to the present time that the bride shall not of herself cross the threshold into her new home, but be lifted up and carried in, because the Sabine women were carried in by force, and did not go in of their own accord” (15). The symbolism of carrying a new bride into her new home represents the entrance into a sacred commitment where her husband will treat her with honor and goodwill. Although the Sabine women have no true autonomy, Plutarch depicts them as content because they were given husbands with virtue.

                            Dante references the Sabine women in Canto VI of his Paradiso. Canto VI is a history of Rome from ancient times through the time of Christ and at last to Emperor Constantine’s conversion. In the story, it is told to Dante by the Roman Emperor Justinian. It is an unorthodox retelling of the history of Rome in that it is told from a Christian point of view and shapes the history of Rome according to its significance in a Christian history. Scholar Robert Hollander suggests that this canto can be read like a Dantean version of a miniaturized Aeneid (1). The poem segments the history of Rome into sixteen sections from the death of Pallas to Charlemagne (2).

                            The section of Roman history right before the Republic in which Rome was ruled by kings is found on lines 40-42. Dante writes in the voice of Justinian, “Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong / Down to Lucretia's sorrow, in seven kings / O'ercoming round about the neighboring nations” (Paradiso, Canto VI, lines 40-41). Justinian marks the beginning and end of this period of Roman history—the foundations of the Republic—with two rapes; it begins with the rape of the Sabines and ends with the rape of Lucretia. Mimicing Justinian’s would-be perspective on the history of Rome, Dante reiterates the significance and renown of these rapes in the Republic’s foundations and in Roman history as it is retold in its whole.

                            Giambologna created this masterpice, The Rape of the Sabine Women, in the 16th century for the Medici family of Florence. The statue now stands in one of Florence’s most popular locations in the Loggia dei Lanzi outside of the Palazzo Vecchio. The piece depicts three figures: a defeated Sabine man on the bottom, a victorious Roman man in the middle, and the abducted Sabine woman in his arms. It captures the emotion of the Rape of the Sabines and tells the story of this event in just one moment. However, the original viewers of the piece were not aware of its significance and a plaque had to be added to explain the scene to onlookers. Giambologna introduces revolutionary dynamics to his work with this sculpture and the placement of his figures is replicated in later works of art on the same subject matter by Nicolas Poussin and Pietro da Cortona.

                            Picasso’s series of paintings, The Rape of the Sabines, is a depiction of Cold War politics painted at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the autumn of 1962. In the paintings, modern empires the Nazi, Napoleonic, Russian and American empires involved in Cold War stand in for the Roman Empire as the protagonists of the rape of the Sabines. The painting centers the suffering of multiple contorted figures—men, women, horses, infants—critiques of the suffering and violence which afflicts innocent people as the result of the major powers’ conflict. Picasso borrows artistic concept and imagery of the sabine women from Poussin’s painting Rape of the Sabine Women (1637-38) and Jacques-Louis David’s The Intervention of the Sabine Women (1799). The Rape of the Sabines is stylistically similar to Picasso’s famous Guernica, created in 1937. The Rape of the Sabines is said to have been painted ten days after American reconnaissance planes first recorded the construction of Soviet missile bases in Cuba. Guernica was similarly an immediate response to wartime developments, responding to the bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil war in 1937. The Rape of the Sabines contributes to a larger canon of artistic depictions of the rape of sabine women in Roman myth. Many of these depictions work off of each other and borrow figures and stylistic formations, but what is important is that they are all actually reproducing a depiction of the intervention of the Sabine women in the conflict between Roman settlers and Sabine people. This is the same intervention detailled in Ovid’s poetry in Fasti. The intervention is still a crucial part of the Sabine womens’ story and the foundational myth of Rome, but for many paintings like Picasso’s which are titled The Rape of the Sabines (for example, Poussin’s Rape of the Sabine Women), artists are actually reproducing a different part of the myth. It is interesting to think about what source material these artists were familiar with and working with during their creation process, and what story about the Sabine women latched on to contemporary consciousness in each of the artists’ times.

                            In the 2014 play “The Rape of the Sabine Women by Grace B. Matthias,” writer Michael Yates Crowley and director Tyne Rafaeli reinterpret the Roman myth through a contemporary lens to explore perceptions of gender and sex violence. The central character Grace B. Matthias creates a narrative focused on the trauma and complexities of being a sexual assault survivor. The play calls for a deeper societal understanding and respect for consent while pointing out how historical narratives can shape perceptions of modern issues like gender and sex violence. According to Jesse Green of the New York Times, the play is able to address the severity of rape and its repercussions while simultaneously relaying the empowering victim narrative that is used in the ancient myth. Using the ancient Roman myth of the Rape of the Sabine Women is a bold mechanism to address the urgent and pervasive issues of gender and sex violence in the world today.
